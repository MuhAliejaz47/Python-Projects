The color_list that you see in the code is extracted from the image given in the code.
It was extracted by the python library called colorgram.

You can install the library by typing:

pip install colorgram.py

in your CMD

Once the library is installed. 

import colorgram


colors = colorgram.extract('your_image_name.jpg', 30) ## any number of colors you want to extract

for color in colors:
  r = color.rgb.r
  g = color.rgb.g
  b = color.rgb.b
  new_colors = (r,g,b)
  rgb_colors.append(new_color)

print(rgb_colors)


Use this code above my replacing the 'your_image_name' by actual name of you image,
and make sure it is in the same directory.

The console will output all the rgb colors.
Copy them and paste them into your code and assign a variable to that list, 
as I assigned 'color_list'

Note:
Try to remove the colors that have values close to 256 in all three planes. Because the can be a shade of white and will efeect your drawing.

Thank you. Enjoy :)
